# AWS Console Title Bar

Chrome Plugin: [AWS Console Title Bar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aws-console-title-bar/jhenfbkjfncfbimbkhakchbdefigenfp?hl=en)

FireFox Plugin [AWS Console Title Bar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/aws-console-title-bar/)

The AWS Console Title Bar is a plugin designed to assist users of the AWS Console with SSO who have multiple accounts. It helps them identify the account they are currently logged into by displaying the account name on the menu bar in the console's top right corner.

To allow the plugin to work on each AWS Console URL, follow these steps:

1) Install the plugin.
2) Open the AWS Console.
3) Click on the plugin icon in the browser's toolbar. It will have a green dot on it.
4) From the drop-down menu, select "Allow on all AWS Console URLs" or a similar option. This will ensure that the plugin works consistently across different AWS Console URLs.

## Export / Import of URLs

The plugin supports exporting and importing URLs. The following JSON structure can be used for exporting and importing URLs:

```json
{
    "urls":[
        {"url":"https://akfdev.com","title":"AKFDEV.con"},
        {"url":"https://akfdev.awsapps.com/start","title":"AWS Console: just-ak"},
        {"url":"https://d-9c6715bd19.awsapps.com/start","title":"AWS Console : TORG"}
    ]
}
```

## Development

### Development Environment Setup

To set up your development environment with oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k, npm, and nvm, follow these steps:

1. **Install oh-my-zsh**:
    ```sh
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```

2. **Install powerlevel10k**:
    ```sh
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
    ```

3. **Set powerlevel10k as the ZSH theme**:
    Edit your `.zshrc` file and set `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"`.

4. **Install nvm**:
    ```sh
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```

5. **Load nvm and install the correct Node.js version**:
    Add the following lines to your `.zshrc` file to load nvm and use the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file:
    ```sh
    export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # This loads nvm bash_completion

    # Load the correct Node.js version from .nvmrc
    autoload -U add-zsh-hook
    load-nvmrc() {
      local node_version="$(nvm version)"
      local nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"

      if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then
        local nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")

        if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then
          nvm install
        elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$node_version" ]; then
          nvm use
        fi
      elif [ "$node_version" != "$(nvm version default)" ]; then
        echo "Reverting to nvm default version"
        nvm use default
      fi
    }
    add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
    load-nvmrc
    ```

6. **Install npm**:
    ```sh
    nvm install --lts/iron
    nvm use --lts/iron
    ```

7. **Verify the installation**:
    ```sh
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

## Current Problems

There are a couple of known issues with the plugin:

1. Browser plugins don't resize correctly after creation.
2. The HTML5 color picker doesn't work properly on Firefox for browser plugins. The plugin uses [https://github.com/mdbassit/Coloris](https://github.com/mdbassit/Coloris) as a workaround.
